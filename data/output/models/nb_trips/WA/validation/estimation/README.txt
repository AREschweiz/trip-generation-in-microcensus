The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate two files here: 'ordinalLogit.html' and 'ordinalLogit.pickle'.
They are the outputs from the estimation of the choice model for the number of trips from home to work,
based on only 80% of the data.
The HTML file contains results that can be read by humans (using a browser);
The pickle file is a binary file of the results of the estimation, that can be used in another Python script.
