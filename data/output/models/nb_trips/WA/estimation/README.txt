The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate three files here: 'ordinalLogit.html', 'ordinalLogit.tex' and 'ordinalLogit.pickle'.
They are the outputs from the estimation of the choice model for the number of trips from home to work.
The HTML file contains results that can be read by humans (using a browser);
The pickle file is a binary file of the results of the estimation, that can be used in another Python script.
